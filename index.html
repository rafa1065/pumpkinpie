        <li>Make the dough by hand. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, and salt. Using your fingers,
            work the butter into the dry ingredients until it resembles yellow corn meal mixed with bean-sized bits of
            butter. (If the flour/butter mixture gets warm, refrigerate it for 10 minutes before proceeding.) Add the
            egg and stir the dough together with a fork or by hand in the bowl. If the dough is dry, sprinkle up to a
            tablespoon more of cold water over the mixture</li>

        <li>Alternatively, make the dough in a food processor. With the machine fitted with the metal blade, pulse the
            flour, sugar, and salt until combined. Add the butter and pulse until it resembles yellow corn meal mixed
            with bean-sized bits of butter, about 10 times. Add the egg and pulse 1 to 2 times; don't let the dough form
            into a ball in the machine. (If the dough is very dry add up to a tablespoon more of cold water.) Remove the
            bowl from the machine, remove the blade, and bring the dough together by hand. </li>

        <li>Form the dough into a disk, wrap with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, at least 1
            hour.</li>

        <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough with a rolling pin into a 12-inch circle about 1/8-inch thick.

            Remove the bowl from the machine, remove the blade, and bring the dough together by hand.</li>

        <li>Set separate racks in the center and lower third of oven and preheat to 400 degrees F. Put a piece of
            parchment paper or foil over the pie shell and fill with dried beans or pie weights. Bake on a baking sheet
            on the center rack until the dough is set, about 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and lift sides of the
            parchment paper to remove the beans. Continue baking until the pie shell is lightly golden brown, about 10
            more minutes. Cool on a rack.</li>

            filling. </li>

        <li>Bake on the lower oven rack until the edges of the filling are set but the center is still slightly loose,
            about 50 to 60 minutes.<small> (If the edges get very dark, cover them with aluminum foil.)</small> Cool on
            a rack. Serve room temperature or slightly warm.</li>

    <h3>Cook’s Note</h3>
    </p>
    <p>
    <h5> You can use the second pie crust to make cut-outs for decorating the pie. Roll it out, cut into desired shapes
        and bake at 350 degrees F on a parchment-lined baking sheet until just beginning to turn golden, 15 to 20
        minutes. When measuring flour, we spoon it into a dry measuring cup and level off excess. (Scooping directly
        from the bag compacts the flour, resulting in dry baked goods.)</h5>
